### Pod
* A unique k8s concept
* Layer of abstraction
* That is, a resource type that wraps around one or more containers 
  * that all share the same IP address
  * and the same deployment mechanism.
* all containers in a pod will deploy together on the same node, having access to each other over localhost and a few things(e.g. IP addresses)
* Unlike Docker, a container cannot be created directly, but can create pods(via CLI, YAML, or API), and k8s then created the container inside the pods
  * More specifically `kubelet` tells the container runtime(e.g. Docker, containerd, cri-o, etc.) to create the containers

### Kubernetes Run
```bash
# kube version
kubectl version
kubectl version --short

# create a pod(kubectl run {pod_name} --image {image_name})
# k8s API receives the request and stored the entry(that my-nginx pod needs to be created) in its db(etcd)
kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx

# list the pods
kubectl get pods

# see all objects
# it doesn't list namely all objects, but the ones that a 'normal' developer will be interested in
kubectl get all

kubectl delete pod my-nginx
```

### Diagram for `kubectl run`

![img](/img/data_engineering/kubernetes/k8s2.png)
* 1) request a pod to the control plane(api server + controller manager + etcd + more) == `kubectl run my-nginx --image nginx`
* 2) api server receives the request, store in the database as a pod request
* 3) the scheduler will assign it to a node
* 4) the kubelet agent, which has a persistent connection to the API, will see a new request for a pod on its node
* 5) the kubelet agent interprets how many containers to create
* 6) kubelet then tells the container runtime(e.g. docker, containerd, etc.)
* 7) container runtime creates the container
