### Declarative Kubernetes YAML
* Kubectl apply
* Kubernetes Configuration YAML
* Building YAML Files
  * Building YAML spec
* Dry Runs and Diff's
* Labels and Annotations

---

### Kubectl apply

```bash
kubectl apply -f filename.yaml
```

---

### Kubernetes Configuration YAML
* Each file contains one or more manifests
* Each manifest describe an API object(e.g. deployment, job, secret, etc.)
* Each manifest needs four parts(`apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`)

#### Pod

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
    - name: nginx
      image: nginx:1.17.3
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

#### Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1 # api version is different with above since it is related with the kind(in this case deployment)
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 2
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.17.3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

#### Deployment & Service

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector:
    app: app-nginx
--- # way of telling k8s that the code above and below are entities
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector: # how one object find the resources that it wants to talk to 
    matchLabels:
      app: app-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.17.3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

---

### Building YAML Files
* `kind`: get a list of resources the cluster supports(`kubectl api-resources`)
  * List will get longer when third party tools gets included
  * Some Resource have multiple API's
  * Find the documents of the corresponding `APIVERSION`
* `apiVersion`: get the api version the cluster supports(`kubectl api-versions`)
* `kind` & `apiVersion` together decides which resource to get and which api version will be used for the service
* `metadata`: only name is required
* `spec`: where all the action is at


#### Building YAML spec

```bash
# get all the keys each kind supports
kubectl explain services --recursive
kubectl explain deployment --recursive

kubectl explain services.spec # see only 'spec' service
kubectl explain services.spec.type # see only the 'type' key (of spec service)
```

---

### Dry Runs and Diff's
* Supported after k8s 1.15

```bash
kubectl apply -f app.yml --dry-run=client
kubectl apply -f app.yml --dry-run=server

# show changes between the one running on the server and the current YAML file
# does not check errors
kubectl diff -f app.yml
```

---

### Labels and Annotations
* Labels goes under `metadata` in the YAML, which are optional
* List of `key: value` pair for identifying resources later by selecting, grouping, or filtering
* Common examples include `tier: backend`, `app: api`, `env: prod`
* Annotations are used often to store config data(proxy, ingress)

```bash
# filter a get command
kubectl get pods -l app=nginx

# apply only matching labels
kubectl apply -f myfile.yaml -l app=nginx
```

#### Label Selectors
* Telling `Services` and `Deployments` which pod are theirs
* Many resources use `Label Selectors` to "link" resources dependencies
  * Which is why `Service`, and `Deployment` kind YAML have these `Label Selectors`
* controls which pods go to which nodes

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: app-nginx-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 80
  selector: 
    app: app-nginx # key, value of a label for pods that it needs to direct traffic to
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: app-nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector: # how one object find the resources that it wants to talk to 
    matchLabels:
      app: app-nginx #  selecting pods based on app-nginx match
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: app-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.17.3
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
