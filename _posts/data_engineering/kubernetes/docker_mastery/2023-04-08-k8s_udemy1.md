### Kubernetes Overview
* Kubernetes Terminology
* Kubernetes Control Plane
* Kubernetes Container Abstractions

---

### Kubernetes Terminology
* `Kubectl`: CLI to configure k8s and manage apps
* `Control Plane`: Set of containers running on the (master) nodes that manages the cluster, sometimes called the master
  * Includes API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd and more
  * These containers can be installed in a single master node or can be distributed on multiple master nodes
* `Kubelet`: k8s agent running on nodes(worker), allowing the node to talk back to the k8s master
* `Kube-proxy`: Controls the network, installed on the (worker) nodes

### Kubernetes Control Plane
* etcd: Distributed storage system for key values
  * need multiple k8s containers that will store data inside etcd and manage the cluster
* API: Way to talk to the cluster and issue orders
* Scheduler: Control how and where the containers are placed on the nodes in objects called pods
* Controlled Manager: Looks at the state of the whole cluster and everything that running by using the API.
  * Takes the orders that are giving it(CLI), or the specs, and applies the CLI by determing the difference between what the CLI asked to do and the current state
* CoreDNS: Controls the DNS

### Kubernetes Container Abstractions
* `Pod`: Basic unit of deployment, containers are always in pods
* `Controller`: Create/Updates pods and other objects
  * Variety of Controllers include Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, etc.
* `Service`: Network endpoint to connect to a pod
* `Namespace`: Filtered group of objects in a cluster
* `Secrets`, `ConfigMaps`, and more
