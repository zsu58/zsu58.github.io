### Kubernetes Overview
* Kubernetes Terminology
* Kubernetes Control Plane
* Kubernetes Container Abstractions

---

### Kubernetes Terminology
* `Kubectl`: CLI to configure k8s and manage apps
* `Control Plane`: Set of containers running on the (master) nodes that manages the cluster, sometimes called the master
  * Includes API server, scheduler, controller manager, etcd and more
  * These containers can be installed in a single master node or can be distributed on multiple master nodes
* `Kubelet`: k8s agent running on nodes(worker), allowing the node to talk back to the k8s master
* `Kube-proxy`: Controls the network, installed on the (worker) nodes
* `Container Runtime`: Underlying software that is used to run containers

### Kubernetes Control Plane
* `etcd`: Distributed storage system for key values
  * data stored inside etcd to manage the cluster, ensures there is no conflict between masters
* `API Server`: Way to talk to the cluster and issue orders, so the user's management devices, cli all talk to the API server to interact with k8s cluster
* `Scheduler`: Control how and where the containers are placed on the nodes in objects called pods
* `Controlled Manager`: Looks at the state of the whole cluster and everything that is running by using the API.
  * Takes the orders that are giving it(CLI), or the specs, and applies the CLI by determining the difference between what the CLI asked to do and the current state
* CoreDNS: Controls the DNS

### Kubernetes Container Abstractions
* `Pod`: Basic unit of deployment, containers are always in pods
* `Controller`: Create/Updates pods and other objects
  * Variety of Controllers include Deployment, ReplicaSet, StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Job, CronJob, etc.
* `Service`: Network endpoint to connect to a pod
* `Namespace`: Filtered group of objects in a cluster
* `Secrets`, `ConfigMaps`, and more
