### Kubernetes Management Techniques
* YAML Generators in kubectl commands
* Imperative vs Desclarative
* Three Management Approaches

---

### YAML Generators in kubectl commands
* `kubectl create` use helper templates called `generators`
  * Generators can have different defaults by version
* Every resource in k8s has a specification(`spec`)

```bash
# see the deployment templates with --dry-run=client -o yaml
kubectl create deployment test --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

# see the job templates with --dry-run=client -o yaml
kubectl create job test --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml

# see the service templates with --dry-run=client -o yaml
kubectl create deployment test --image nginx # deployment needed to expose
kubectl expose deploy test --port 80 --dry-run=client -o yaml
```

---

### Imperative vs Desclarative
* `Imperative`: Focuses on how a program operates
  * For example, boil water, get 42 gram of medium-fine grounds, and poor over 700 grams of water, etc
  * In k8s, the command lines (`kubectl run | create | update | etc. `) are imperative
* `Desclarative`: Focuses on what a program should accomplish
  * For example, "Barista i'd like a cup of coffee"
  * In k8s, yaml find can be used(`kubectl apply -f values.yaml`)

---

### Three Management Approaches
* Imperative commands: `kubectl run | expose | scale | edit | create deployment | etc.`
  * Best for dev/learning/personal projects
  * Easy to learn, hardest to manage 
* Imperative objects: `create | replace -f values.yaml`, etc.
  * Good for prod of small environments, single file per command
  * Store changes in git-based yaml files
* Declarative: `apply -f values.yaml | dir/ | diff`
  * Best for prod, easier to automate
  * Harder to understand and predict changes
* Do not mix the approaches in production!
