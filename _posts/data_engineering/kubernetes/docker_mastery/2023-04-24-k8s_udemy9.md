### Kubernetes Services DNS
* Starting with 1.11, CoreDNS is provided as an internal DNS
* When using hostnames(e.g. `curl {hostname}`) it works only when the services are in the same NameSpace
* If not, FQDN(Fully Qualified Domain Name) is required (e.g. `curl {hostname}.{namespace}.svc.cluster.local`)
