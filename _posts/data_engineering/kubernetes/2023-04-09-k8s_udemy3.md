### Kubernetes Create CLI
* 
```bash
# As docker container cannot have two identical container names,
# k8s cannot have two identical resource with the same name in the same namespace
# cf. the previous resource_type == "pod", currently resource_tpye == "deployment", therefore can make it with the name "my-nginx" without deleting the pod
kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image nginx

kubectl get pods

# can seet that 7cddc5685c is identical(meaning that the my-nginx pod was )
kubectl get all
# NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# pod/my-nginx-7cddc5685c-wqq9j   1/1     Running   0          38s
# 
# NAME                                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
# replicaset.apps/my-nginx-7cddc5685c   1         1         1  

kubectl delete deployment my-nginx
```

### Diagram for `kubectl create`

![img](/img/data_engineering/kubernetes/k8s2.png)
* 1) ask the api server for deployment == `kubectl create deployment my-nginx --image nginx`
* 2) api server receives the command and store it in the etcd
* 3) controller manager looks at all the different resource types, and when it sees a new resource type, a controller that's in charge of the resource type(resource_type == "deployment") creates a ReplicaSet
  * cf. the controller for resource type pod and deployment are built into every k8s
  * a deployment can't create pods directly but create as ReplicaSet
  * so for each version that a deployement is made, a new ReplicaSet is created, meaning that the old version and the new version are running at the same time
* 4) ReplicaSet controller, which is a part of the controller manager, would see the ReplicaSet definition and know that it needs to create some pods.
* 5) the pods will be created by adding them to the database (by the ReplicaSet controller)
* 6) The scheduler notices that the pods have not been scheduled to a node.
