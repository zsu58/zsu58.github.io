### Style Guides and Rules
* We maintain separate style guides for each of the programming languages used at
Google
    * Many of our style guides have external versions, which you can find at [ðŸ”— Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide)
* At a high level, all of the guides have similar goals, aiming to steer code development with an eye to sustainability
* At the same time, there is a lot of variation among them in scope, length, and content.
* Programming languages have different strengths, different features, different priorities, and different historical paths to adoption within Googleâ€™s ever-evolving repositories of code

### Guiding Principles
* Pull their weight
    * Not everything should go into a style guide
* Optimize for the reader
* Be consistent
    * However, it is not always enough for an organization to create and stick to a set of internal conventions. Sometimes, the standards adopted by the external community should be taken into account
    * If conventions already exist, it is usually a good idea for an organization to be consistent with the outside world
    * Looking long-term, adhering to the widely accepted standard will likely pay off
* Avoid error-prone and surprising constructs
    * We place higher value on simplified, straightforward code that is easier to understand and maintain.
* Concede to practicalities when necessary
    * In our quest for a consistent, simplified codebase, we do not want to blindly ignore all else
    * Performance matters
    * Interoperability also matters

### TL;DR
*
