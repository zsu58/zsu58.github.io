### Style Guides and Rules
* We maintain separate style guides for each of the programming languages used at
Google
    * Many of our style guides have external versions, which you can find at [ðŸ”— Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide)
* At a high level, all of the guides have similar goals, aiming to steer code development with an eye to sustainability
