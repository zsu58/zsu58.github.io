### Setting the Stage: Psychological Safety
* Psychological safety is critical to promoting a learning environment
* To learn, you must first acknowledge that there are things you don’t understand. We should welcome such honesty rather than punish it
* An enormous part of learning is being able to try things and feeling safe to fail
* One important way of building psychological safety is to assign a mentor someone who is not their team member manager, or tech lead whose responsibilities explicitly include answering questions and helping ramping up

### Growing Your Knowledge
* Learning is not just about understanding new things; it also includes developing an understanding of the decisions behind the design and implementation of existing things
    * Seek out and understand context, especially for decisions that seem unusual. After you’ve understood the context and purpose of the code, consider whether your change still makes sense

### Scaling Your Questions: Ask the Community
* Use the following community to ask questions
    * Group Chats
    * Mailing Lists
    * Question-and-Answer Platform

### Scaling Your Knowledge
* Use the following source to increase/spread knowledge
    * Office Hours
    * Tech Talks and Classes
    * Documentation
    * Code and Comments

### Scaling Your Organization’s Knowledge
* Be aware of the following for cultivating a knowledge-sharing culture
    * Respect
    * Incentives and recognition

### Readability: Standardized Mentorship Through Code Review
* Code review is mandatory at Google
* Every changelist (CL) requires readability approval, which indicates that someone who has readability certification for that language has approved the CL
* Certified authors implicitly provide readability approvalof their own CLs; otherwise, one or more qualified reviewers must explicitly give readability approval for the CL

### TL;DR
* Psychological safety is the foundation for fostering a knowledge-sharing environment
* Make it easy for people to get the help they need from both human experts and documented references
* At a systemic level, encourage and reward those who take time to teach and broaden their expertise beyond just themselves, their team, or their organization
* There is no silver bullet: empowering a knowledge-sharing culture requires a combination of multiple strategies, and the exact mix that works best for your organization will likely change over time
