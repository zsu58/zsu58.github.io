### Setting the Stage: Psychological Safety
* Psychological safety is critical to promoting a learning environment
* To learn, you must first acknowledge that there are things you don’t understand. We should welcome such honesty rather than punish it
* An enormous part of learning is being able to try things and feeling safe to fail
* One important way of building psychological safety is to assign a mentor someone who is not their team member manager, or tech lead whose responsibilities explicitly include answering questions and helping ramping up

### Growing Your Knowledge
* Learning is not just about understanding new things; it also includes developing an understanding of the decisions behind the design and implementation of existing things
    * Seek out and understand context, especially for decisions that seem unusual. After you’ve understood the context and purpose of the code, consider whether your change still makes sense
