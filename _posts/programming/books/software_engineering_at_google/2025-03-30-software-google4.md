### Bias Is the Default
* When engineers do not focus on users of different nationalities, ethnicities, races, genders, ages, socioeconomic statuses, abilities, and belief systems, even the most talented staff will inadvertently fail their users

### Understanding the Need for Diversity
* At Google, we believe that being an exceptional engineer requires that you also focus on bringing diverse perspectives into product design and implementation


### Values Versus Outcomes
* Take a hard look in the mirror
* Don’t build for everyone. Build with everyone
* Design for the user who will have the most difficulty using your product
* Don’t assume equity; measure equity throughout your systems
* Change is possible

### TL;DR
* Bias is the default
* Diversity is necessary to design properly for a comprehensive user base
* Inclusivity is critical not just to improving the hiring pipeline for underrepresented groups, but to providing a truly supportive work environment for all people
* Product velocity must be evaluated against providing a product that is truly useful to all users. It’s better to slow down than to release a product that might cause harm to some users
