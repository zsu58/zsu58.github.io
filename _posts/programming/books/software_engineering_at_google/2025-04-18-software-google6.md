### The Three Always of leadership
* Always Be Deciding
* Always Be Leaving
* Always Be Scaling

### Always Be Deciding
* At the highest level, your job as a leader—either of a single team or a larger organization—is to guide people toward solving difficult, ambiguous problems
* By ambiguous, we mean that the problem has no obvious solution and might even be unsolvable
* There are three main steps to this process; First, you need to identify the blinders; next, you need to identify the trade-offs; and then you need to decide and iterate on a solution

### Identify the Blinders
* Blinders are folks that have been steeped in the problem for so long that they’re wearing “blinders”—that is, they’re no longer able to see the forest

### Identify the Key Trade-Offs
* By definition, important and ambiguous problems do not have magic“silver bullet solutions, It’s your job to call out the trade-offs, explain them to everyone, and then help decide how to balance them

### Decide, Then Iterate
* After you understand the trade-offs and how they work, use this information to make the best decision for this particular month
* Next month, you might need to reevaluate and rebalance the trade-offs again; it’s an iterative process
* You need to make your teams comfortable with iteration

### Always Be Leaving
* It’s not just your job to solve an ambiguous problem, but to get your organization to solve it by itself, without you present

### Your Mission: Build a Self-Driving Team
* Again, there are three main parts to constructing this sort of self-sufficient group: dividing the problem space, delegating subproblems, and iterating as needed

### Always Be Scaling
* As a leader, your most precious resource is your limited pool of time, attention, and energy

### Important Versus Urgent
* As you moved into leadership, though, you might have noticed that your main mode of work became less predictable and more about firefighting. That is, your job became less proactive and more reactive. The higher up in leadership you go, the more escalations you receive
*  If you let yourself slip into pure reactive mode (which happens almost automatically), you spend every moment of your life on urgent things, but almost none of those things are important in the big picture
* Here are a few key techniques to force yourself to work mostly on important things
    * Delegate
    * Schedule dedicated time
    * Find a tracking system that works

### Learn to Drop Balls
* And so now, as you work through your tasks, do not try to tackle the top 80%—you’ll still end up overwhelmed and mostly working on urgent-but-not-important tasks
* Instead, mindfully identify the balls that strictly fall in the top 20%—critical things that only you can do—and focus strictly on them

### Protecting Your Energy
* Take real vacations
* Make it trivial to disconnect
* Take real weekends, too
* Take breaks during the day
* Give yourself permission to take a mental health day


### TL;DR
* Always Be Deciding: Ambiguous problems have no magic answer; they’re all about finding the right trade-offs of the moment, and iterating
* Always Be Leaving: Your job, as a leader, is to build an organization that automatically solves a class of ambiguous problems—over time—without you needing to be present
*  Always Be Scaling: Success generates more responsibility over time, and you must proactively manage the scaling of this work in order to protect your scarce resources of personal time, attention, and energy
