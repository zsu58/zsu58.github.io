### The Genius Myth
* The vast majority of the work at Google (and at most companies!) doesn’t require genius-level intellect, but 100% of the work requires a minimal level of social skills
* What will make or break your career, especially at a company like Google, is how well you collaborate with others

### Hiding Considered Harmful
* Get feedback as early as possible, test as early as possible, and think about security and production environments as early as possible

### It’s All About the Team
* Software engineering is a team endeavor

### The Three Pillars of Social Interaction
* Pillar 1: Humility
    * You are not the center of the universe (nor is your code!). You’re neither omniscient nor infallible. You’re open to self-improvement
* Pillar 2: Respect
    * You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them kindly and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments
* Pillar 3: Trust
    * You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and you’re OK with letting them drive when appropriate

### Humility, Respect, and Trust in Practice
* Learn to respect your peers and give constructive criticism politely
* Learn to accept criticism as well
    * You are not your code


### TL;DR
* A small investment in understanding personalities and working styles of yourself and others can go a long way toward improving productivity
* To work effectively with a team or a large organization, be aware of
your preferred working style and that of other
