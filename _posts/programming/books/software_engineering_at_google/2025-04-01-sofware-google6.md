### The Engineering Manager
* At the highest level, an engineering manager is responsible for the performance, productivity, and happiness of every person on their team

### The Tech Lead
* The tech lead (TL) of a team—who will often report to the manager of that team—is responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project management

### The Tech Lead Manager
* On small and nascent teams for which engineering managers need a strong technical skill set, the default is often to have a TLM: a single person who can handle both the people and technical needs of their team
* At Google, it’s customary for larger, well-established teams to have a pair of leaders—one TL and one engineering manager—working together as partners

### Moving from an Individual Contributor Role to a Leadership Role
* Quantifying management work is more difficult than counting widgets you turned out, but just making it possible for your team to be happy and productive is a big measure of your job. Just don’t fall into the trap of counting apples when you’re growing bananas
* Great reasons to consider becoming a TL or manager
    * First, it’s a way to scale yourself
    * Second, you might just be really good at it

### Servant Leadership
* The symptoms of this disease include, but are by no means limited to, micromanaging, ignoring low performers, and hiring pushovers
* To avoid this, above all, resist the urge to manage
* The cure for the management disease is a liberal application of servant leadership, which is a nice way of saying the most important thing you can do as a leader is to serve your team, much like a butler or majordomo tends to the health and well-being of a household

### Today's Engineering Manager
* Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, whereas great managers worry about what things get done (and trust their team to figure out how to do it).

### Antipatterns
* Hire Pushovers
    * You should strive to hire people who are smarter than you and can replace you
* Ignore Low Performers
    * How do you effectively coach a low performer? The best analogy is to imagine that you’re helping a limping person learn to walk again, then jog, then run alongside the rest of the team. It almost always requires temporary micromanagement, but still a whole lot of humility, respect, and trust—particularly respect
* Ignore Human Issues
* Be Everyone’s Friend
    * Don’t confuse friendship with leading with a soft touch
* Compromise the Hiring Bar
    * Steve Jobs once said: “A people hire other A people; B people hire C people.”
* Treat Your Team Like Children

### Positive Patterns


### TL;DR
