### The Engineering Manager
* At the highest level, an engineering manager is responsible for the performance, productivity, and happiness of every person on their team

### The Tech Lead
* The tech lead (TL) of a team—who will often report to the manager of that team—is responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project management

### The Tech Lead Manager
* On small and nascent teams for which engineering managers need a strong technical skill set, the default is often to have a TLM: a single person who can handle both the people and technical needs of their team
* At Google, it’s customary for larger, well-established teams to have a pair of leaders—one TL and one engineering manager—working together as partners

### Moving from an Individual Contributor Role to a Leadership Role
* Quantifying management work is more difficult than counting widgets you turned out, but just making it possible for your team to be happy and productive is a big measure of your job. Just don’t fall into the trap of counting apples when you’re growing bananas
* Great reasons to consider becoming a TL or manager
    * First, it’s a way to scale yourself
    * Second, you might just be really good at it
