### The Three Always of leadership
* Always Be Deciding
* Always Be Leaving
* Always Be Scaling

### Always Be Deciding
* At the highest level, your job as a leader—either of a single team or a larger organization—is to guide people toward solving difficult, ambiguous problems
* By ambiguous, we mean that the problem has no obvious solution and might even be unsolvable
* There are three main steps to this process; First, you need to identify the blinders; next, you need to identify the trade-offs; and then you need to decide and iterate on a solution

### Identify the Blinders
* Blinders are folks that have been steeped in the problem for so long that they’re wearing “blinders”—that is, they’re no longer able to see the forest

### Identify the Key Trade-Offs
* By definition, important and ambiguous problems do not have magic“silver bullet solutions, It’s your job to call out the trade-offs, explain them to everyone, and then help decide how to balance them

### Decide, Then Iterate
* After you understand the trade-offs and how they work, use this information to make the best decision for this particular month
* Next month, you might need to reevaluate and rebalance the trade-offs again; it’s an iterative process
* You need to make your teams comfortable with iteration

### Always Be Leaving
* It’s not just your job to solve an ambiguous problem, but to get your organization to solve it by itself, without you present


### TL;DR
