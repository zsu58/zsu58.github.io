### Three critical differences between programming and software engineering
* Time
    * Your project is sustainable if, for the expected life span of your software, you are capable of react‐
ing to whatever valuable change comes along, for either technical or business reasons
* Scale
    * A programming task is often an act of individual creation, but a software engineering task is a team effort
* Trade-offs at play
    * The job of a software engineer, or a software engineering leader, is to aim for sustainability and
management of the scaling costs for the organization, the product, and the development workflow

### Time and Change
* Getting through not only that first big upgrade, but getting to the point at which you can reliably stay current going forward, is the essence of long-term sustainability for your project
* Sustainability requires planning and managing the impact of required change
* Over time, we need to be much more aware of the difference between "happens to work" and "is maintainable"
* Code that depends on brittle and unpublished features of its dependencies is likely to be described as "hacky" or "clever," whereas code that follows best practices and has planned for the future is more likely to be described as "clean" and "maintainable."
* Change is not inherently good. We shouldn’t change just for the sake of change. But we do need to be capable of change
